   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=your_google_service_account_json_here
   ```

## Configuration

### OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file as `OPENAI_API_KEY`

### Google Drive Setup

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

   - You can either paste the entire JSON content or provide the file path

5. **Set up Google Drive Folders**
   - Create a folder in Google Drive for your job files
   - Create a blank Word document template named "Scope-Summary.docx"
   - Share both the folder and template with your service account email (found in the JSON file)
   - Note down the folder ID and template file ID from their URLs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"wkhtmltopdf not found"**
   - Make sure wkhtmltopdf is installed and in your system PATH
   - On macOS: `brew install wkhtmltopdf`

2. **"ffmpeg not found"**
   - Install ffmpeg using your system package manager
   - On macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`

3. **Google Drive authentication errors**
   - Verify your service account JSON is correct
   - Ensure the service account has access to your Drive folder and template
   - Check that the folder and file IDs are correct

4. **OpenAI API errors**
   - Verify your API key is correct and has sufficient credits
   - Check that you have access to GPT-4 and Whisper APIs

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the error details in the expandable error section
2. Verify all prerequisites are installed
3. Ensure your `.env` file is properly configured
4. Check that all required permissions are granted

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API keys and service account credentials secure
- The service account only needs access to specific folders, not your entire Drive
- Consider using environment-specific API keys for development vs. production
